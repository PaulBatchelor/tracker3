# Seq16

![Seq16](img.png)

Seq16 is a minimalist 16-step drum sequencer, that is spawned from inside
of Sporth. 

In a space of only 264 x 88 pixels, Seq16 has *just* enough 
features to leave you wanting more:

- 4 16-step patterns
- save/load pattern sets
- vi-inspired navigation
- Sample-accurate Clock
- ability to work with live-coding (will close and reopen cleanly)

## Compiling

To compile on Linux, run "make".

Then run the test patch:
    sporth -b jack -c 2 test.sp

## Using Seq16

Looking into [test.sp](test.sp) is a good way to see how to use Seq16. 
Seq16 is loaded into Sporth as a custom ugen plugin. It creates a table
with 4 elements in it. It is also fed a clock signal generated by Sporth. 
When Sporth sends a trigger to Seq16, it will advance one step in time.
The ftable contains the state of each 16-step pattern at the current 
point in time, 1 for on, 0 for off. These signals can be multiplied with the 
clock signal to produce a rhythmic trigger signal that can be used inside
of Sporth.
